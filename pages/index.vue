        <h2>Motivation ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•</h2>
        <p>
          Being a solopreneur is hard. You have to do everything yourself: from
          building a product to marketing and selling it. You will be wearing
          multiple hats at the same time and it's easy to get overwhelmed.
        </p>

        <p>
          One day, I encountered this tweet from
          <a
            href="https://twitter.com/quattonbud/status/1677043871619100677"
            target="_blank"

          >

          </a>
          and I got inspired to build a tool around it. Markit is designed to be
          minimal and simple, so it's not a replacement for a full-blown
          marketing course. (So if you want to sponsor by promoting your
          marketing course or service here, feel free to!)
        </p>

        <p>
          Markit is basically a word-play on "market" and "kit". It's short and
          catchy, and I really love it! I'm building Markit for myself and for
          other developers, so it might not be directly applicable to other
          types of product.
        </p>
