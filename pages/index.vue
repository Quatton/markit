        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Being a solopreneur is hard. You have to do everything yourself: from
          building a product to marketing and selling it. There are a lot of
          things to do and it's easy to get overwhelmed.
        </p>

          One day, I encountered this tweet from
          <a
            href="https://twitter.com/quattonbud/status/1677043871619100677"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >

          </a>
          and I got inspired to build a tool around it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Markit is basically a word-play on "market" and "kit". It's short and
          catchy, and I really love it! I'm building Markit for myself and for
          other developers, so it might not be directly applicable to other
          types of product. Markit is designed to be minimal and simple, so it's
          not a replacement for a full-blown marketing course. (So if you want
          to sponsor by promoting your marketing course or service here, feel
          free to!)
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm by no means an expert in marketing, but I'm learning and I want to
          share my knowledge with others.
