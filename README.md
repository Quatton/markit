‚ö†Ô∏èWarning: This project is not open-source ready yet. Please don't submit any pull requests until I finish the initial setup.‚ö†Ô∏è

## Building a software product but not sure how to sell?

Markit is interactive tutorial for solopreneurs that will help you validate your idea and build a marketing strategy from pre-sale to post-launch. 

Open-source and 100% free.

## Motivation

Being a solopreneur is hard. You have to do everything yourself: from building a product to marketing and selling it. There are a lot of things to do and it's easy to get overwhelmed.

One day, I encountered this tweet from [Dan Kulkov](https://twitter.com/quattonbud/status/1677043871619100677) and I got inspired to build a tool around it so I replied to him.

Markit is basically a word-play on "market" and "kit". It's short and catchy, and I really love it! I'm building Markit for myself and for other developers, so it might not be directly applicable to other types of product. Markit is designed to be minimal and simple, so it's not a replacement for a full-blown marketing course. (So if you want to sponsor by promoting your marketing course or service here, feel free to!)

I'm by no means an expert in marketing, but I'm learning and I want to share my knowledge with others.

## Features
